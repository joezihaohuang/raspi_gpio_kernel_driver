# raspi_gpio_kernel_driver

Creating a Linux kernel driver for controlling an LED on a Raspberry Pi involves writing a kernel module. Here's an outline of the steps:

1. **Set up a Development Environment:**
   Ensure that you have a development environment for the Raspberry Pi kernel. You can cross-compile the kernel on a host computer or build the kernel directly on the Raspberry Pi.

2. **Identify the LED GPIO Pin:**
   Determine the GPIO pin you're using for the LED.

3. **Write the Kernel Module:**
   Create a kernel module source file. Here's a basic example for controlling an LED:

   ```c
   #include <linux/init.h>
   #include <linux/module.h>
   #include <linux/gpio.h>
   #include <linux/fs.h>

   #define LED_GPIO 17  // Replace with the actual GPIO pin number

   MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
   MODULE_AUTHOR("Your Name");
   MODULE_DESCRIPTION("LED GPIO Control Driver");

   static int led_gpio_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
   {
       // Configure GPIO as output
       gpio_direction_output(LED_GPIO, 1);
       return 0;
   }

   static int led_gpio_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
   {
       // Release GPIO
       gpio_set_value(LED_GPIO, 0);
       return 0;
   }

   static struct file_operations fops = {
       .open = led_gpio_open,
       .release = led_gpio_release,
   };

   static int __init led_gpio_init(void)
   {
       if (gpio_request(LED_GPIO, "led_gpio")) {
           pr_err("Failed to request GPIO %d\n", LED_GPIO);
           return -1;
       }
       register_chrdev(0, "led_gpio", &fops);
       return 0;
   }

   static void __exit led_gpio_exit(void)
   {
       unregister_chrdev(0, "led_gpio");
       gpio_free(LED_GPIO);
   }

   module_init(led_gpio_init);
   module_exit(led_gpio_exit);
   ```

4. **Compile and Load the Module:**
   Cross-compile the module if necessary and load it onto your Raspberry Pi:

   ```bash
   make
   sudo insmod your_module.ko
   ```

5. **Test the Driver:**
   Once the module is loaded, you can interact with it using a user-space program to control the LED.

6. **Unload the Module:**
   When done, unload the module:

   ```bash
   sudo rmmod your_module
   ```

This is a basic example to get you started. In a real-world scenario, you may want to implement error handling and more advanced features. Make sure to configure your GPIO pin and LED specifications correctly in the code.

Be cautious when working with kernel modules, as an incorrect driver can potentially crash your system or damage hardware. It's crucial to have a good understanding of kernel development and to follow best practices and guidelines for writing Linux kernel modules.


To use the user space program to control the LED using the Linux kernel driver you've created, you can interact with the driver through device files. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a Device File:**
   In your kernel module, you've implemented file operations for opening and releasing the device. You need to create a device file and associate it with your driver. This is typically done using `mknod` or `udev` rules. Assuming you named your module "led_gpio," create a device file:

   ```bash
   sudo mknod /dev/led_gpio c 0
   ```

2. **Write a User-Space Program:**
   Create a user-space program that opens and writes to this device file to control the LED. Here's a basic example:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <fcntl.h>
   #include <unistd.h>

   int main() {
       int fd = open("/dev/led_gpio", O_RDWR);

       if (fd < 0) {
           perror("Error opening device file");
           return -1;
       }

       // Turn on the LED
       write(fd, "1", 1);
       sleep(2);

       // Turn off the LED
       write(fd, "0", 1);

       close(fd);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   This user-space program opens the device file, writes "1" to it to turn on the LED, waits for 2 seconds, and then writes "0" to turn it off.

3. **Compile and Run the User-Space Program:**
   Compile the program and run it:

   ```bash
   gcc your_program.c -o led_control
   ./led_control
   ```

   Make sure your user program has the necessary permissions to open and write to the device file. You may need to run it with `sudo` if you encounter permission issues.

By using this approach, you can control the LED from user space through the device file associated with your kernel module. This provides a way to interact with the driver and control the LED using user programs.
